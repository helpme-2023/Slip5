Using nodejs create a web page to read two file names from user and append contents of first file into second file. 

const fs require('fs');

// open destination file for appending

var write fs.createwriteStream("message.txt", (flags: 'a'));

// open source file for reading var readfs.createReadStream("input.txt");

write.on('close', function() { console.log("done writing");
});
read.pipe(write);
